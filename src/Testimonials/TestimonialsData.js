    review: `Sushant has been into multiple projects that i have assigned. From web 
        development to responsive designs using angular, he has been excellent , very 
        precise , and satisfied output. Its been two months the application is performing 
        very smooth. On the other hand, his work on react native side that was my another 
        project for mobile app development, has been very good and well done so far. The 
        most thing about him is making sure the root of the application (functional) is 
        always strong. I have been satisfied with his work. Anyone hiring him will not regret 
        in the future. `,

    review: `I have hired Sushant on my previous two projects. This was the third 
        separate project i hired him for, and like always Sushant completed it in 
        timely manner. Not only he handed the completed project on time but also 
        he did do the work that was much more above my expectation. His react native, 
        angular, and problem solving skills are the best ever i have seen. I would 
        highly recommend any one to hire him in their future projects.`,
